Main Features:
    [ ] Detect if wrong qubits have been initialized
    [ ] Notify the required no of parameters using inspect (will fix the gates issue)
    [ ] Notify unused quibits while measureing
    [ ] auto-complete suggestions for simulators
    [ ] Possible switch to total type-script instead of using Java 



    # Detect if wrong qubits have been initialized:
        [âˆš] fix for number if quantum circuit or any of its alias is used 
        [ ] fix if the input is a list 
        [ ] fix if implemented with quantum registers and classical registers 
        [ ] variable string issues code = """ vale """ is beign parsed make sure strings are not being parsed
